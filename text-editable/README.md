# Text Editable

I use this in place of contenteditable

Wrap some text in a tag named edit, and give some parent element the class "edit-container"
When the edit-container element is clicked, the text wrapped in edit is turned to an input and highlighted.
After the input is focused out, the input value is converted back into text.
